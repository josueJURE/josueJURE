### Hi there I'm JosuÃ© ðŸ‘‹


**josueJURE/josueJURE** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a JS calculator.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JS, CSS, HTML, DOM manipulation, Node.js, Express, testing etc...
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on opend source projects
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with SQL
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about JS, CSS HTML design
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: josue.jure@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I pick up a new language every 3 years. Iâ€™m learning Portuguese, which, including Japanese, is my 5th language.
